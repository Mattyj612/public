# UBC MDS public teaching materials

This repository contains publicly available versions of some of the teaching materials from the [UBC MDS program](https://ubc-mds.github.io/). We intend to make
more of the materials public over time. Our current plan is to post the homework assignments (a.k.a. labs) and the lecture notes for a selection of courses. We do not plan to post lab solutions or quizzes at this time. Please follow the links below to our currently available material:
